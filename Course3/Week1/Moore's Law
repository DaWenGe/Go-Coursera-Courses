Moore's Law:

Predicted that transistor density would double every two years leading to more and smaller transistors which can switch faster

Physical limitations:

    1. Increasing transistor density leads to increased power consumption
    2. High power leads to high temperature which might melt the chip if no proper cooling system is present
    3. Voltage scaling cant continue forever
    4. Leakage power has been growing over time
    5. Dynamic power
