Moore's Law:

Predicted that transistor density would double every two years leading to more and smaller transistors which can switch faster

Physical limitations:

    1. Increasing transistor density leads to increased power consumption
    2. High power leads to high temperature which might melt the chip if no proper cooling system is present
    3. Voltage scaling cant continue forever due to noise or threshold Voltage
    4. Leakage power cannot be prevented by voltage scaling
    5. Voltage scaling reduces dynamic power consumption
